# Overview

This program is a simulation of a bank. It is going to collect information of users, their passwords, their amount of money. The first part is going to give the user 3 options: To create an account, to open an account or to exit from the programm. Once the user create an account, the user will be able to open his or her account in order to see the amount of money, to do transaction (retire or deposit), to change the username or the password. 


{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Hashmaps for the first time, create a class in Java, functions, and using the equals.

I used the libraries: HashMaps and Scanner.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Create another file with the information of the bank account. 
* Be able to tranfer money from one user to another
* Have the option to save the password, so the user will not need to remember the password.
